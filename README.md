## Details üóíÔ∏è:
**FTD Firewall:** The first line of defense between the Internet and your internal network.

**Core Switch:** Main internal switch, connecting to Access Switches and Servers.

**DMZ Switch:** Dedicated to public-facing servers (e.g., Web, Email), separated from the internal LAN.

### VLANs Detail:

User VLAN for employee computers and devices.

Server VLAN for internal application/file servers.

Access Switches: Distribute connections to desks, Wi-Fi APs, printers, etc.

### Optional additions:

VPN configured on the FTD for remote employees.

Redundant links (if budget allows).

Guest Wi-Fi isolated on its own VLAN.
